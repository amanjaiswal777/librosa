    "In this notebook, you will build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) pipeline! Your completed pipeline will accept raw audio as input and return a predicted transcription of the spoken language. The full pipeline is summarized in the figure below.\n",

    "STEP 2 is an acoustic model which accepts audio features as input and returns a probability distribution over all potential transcriptions. After learning about the basic types of neural networks that are often used for acoustic modeling, you will engage in your own investigations, to design your own acoustic model!\n",
